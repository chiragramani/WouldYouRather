# Would You Rather

## Project Overview:

For the **Would You Rather** projects, we have to build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this web-app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

### Project Rubric

The project will be evaluated by a Udacity code reviewer according to the [Would You Rather project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view).The rubric should be a resource you refer to periodically to make sure your project meets specifications.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
